        <h3>Hey Pal!</h3>
        <p>My name is Cemal-Emre Kaya, and I am 23 years old.</p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am enrolled at BHT Berlin as a media informatics student
          with the goal of pursuing my master's degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the age of 14, I have been engaging in software development as a
          hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          It started with a small game server, and now I am working hard to
          become a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in every aspect of software development, but I have a
          particularly strong interest in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding how a server operates, how a website is structured, and
          how they collectively represent the World Wide Web fascinates me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, the World Wide Web is nothing more than a vast
          interconnection of individual projects (in my case: React).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By now, fueled by passion and eagerness to learn, I have reached the
          point where I can build
